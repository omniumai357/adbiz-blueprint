# Responsive Issue Management Workflow

This document outlines the standardized process for identifying, documenting, triaging, and resolving responsive design issues in our application.

## Issue Reporting

### Reporting Template

When reporting a responsive issue, use the following template:

```markdown
## Responsive Issue Report

### Basic Information
- **Component**: [Component Name]
- **Device/Environment**: [Device Model/Screen Size]
- **Browser**: [Browser Name and Version]
- **OS**: [Operating System]
- **Breakpoint**: [xs/sm/md/lg/xl/xxl]
- **URL/Route**: [Where the issue appears]

### Issue Description
[Clear, concise description of what's happening]

### Expected Behavior
[Description of what should happen]

### Actual Behavior
[Description of what actually happens]

### Visual Evidence
[Screenshots, screen recordings, or links to visual evidence]

### Reproduction Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **User Impact**: [Description of how it affects users]
- **Affected Breakpoints**: [List all affected breakpoints]

### Additional Notes
[Any other relevant information]
```

## Issue Severity Levels

Issues should be classified according to these severity levels:

1. **Critical**
   - Content completely inaccessible at one or more breakpoints
   - Core functionality broken on specific devices
   - Text completely unreadable
   - Interactive elements completely unusable

2. **High**
   - Significant layout issues that impair usability
   - Important content partially obscured
   - Interactive elements difficult but not impossible to use
   - Significant visual inconsistencies that affect brand perception

3. **Medium**
   - Minor layout or alignment issues
   - Text truncation that doesn't affect comprehension
   - Visual inconsistencies that don't significantly impact usability
   - Performance issues at specific breakpoints

4. **Low**
   - Subtle spacing or alignment issues
   - Minor visual inconsistencies
   - Slight overflow or underflow of content
   - Non-optimized image sizes

## Triage Process

All responsive issues go through the following triage process:

1. **Initial Assessment** (24 hours)
   - Verify reproducibility on reported environment
   - Confirm breakpoint-specific nature
   - Check for duplicate issues
   - Assign initial severity

2. **Impact Analysis** (48 hours)
   - Test on additional devices/browsers
   - Identify affected user segments
   - Determine root cause (layout, styling, content)
   - Update severity if needed

3. **Resolution Planning** (72 hours)
   - Assign to appropriate team member
   - Set target resolution timeframe based on severity
   - Create test plan for verifying the fix
   - Document proposed solution approach

## Resolution Workflow

The standard workflow for resolving responsive issues:

1. **Development**
   - Create a branch for the fix
   - Implement solution for all affected breakpoints
   - Add responsive tests to prevent regression
   - Document any design pattern changes

2. **Testing**
   - Verify fix on original reported environment
   - Test on all breakpoints, not just affected ones
   - Validate on physical devices when possible
   - Run automated visual regression tests

3. **Review**
   - Conduct code review with responsive design focus
   - Have designer review visual changes if applicable
   - Check for any new issues introduced by the fix
   - Verify documentation is updated

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment first
   - Conduct final verification on physical devices
   - Deploy to production with monitoring
   - Update issue tracking with resolution details

## Responsive Testing Dashboard

All responsive issues are tracked in our Responsive Testing Dashboard, which provides:

- Current issue count by severity and component
- Historical trends in responsive issues
- Device coverage metrics
- Responsive test coverage percentage

The dashboard is updated daily and reviewed during sprint planning.

## Preventative Measures

To minimize responsive issues:

1. **Component Review Process**
   - All new components require responsive behavior documentation
   - Visual testing across breakpoints required before merging
   - Designer review of responsive behavior

2. **Development Guidelines**
   - Mobile-first approach for all components
   - Use relative units (rem, %, vh/vw) instead of fixed pixels
   - Test on actual devices, not just browser emulation
   - Use the useResponsive hook consistently

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Monthly responsive design audits of critical flows
   - Quarterly comprehensive site-wide audit
   - Regular performance testing at each breakpoint

## Tools and Resources

### Testing Tools
- Browser DevTools (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- BrowserStack for cross-device testing
- Jest with jest-image-snapshot for visual regression tests
- Custom ResponsiveVisualTest component for development

### Documentation
- [Responsive Testing Protocol](../RESPONSIVE_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md)
- [Component Testing Templates](./COMPONENT_TESTING_TEMPLATE.md)
- [Visual Testing Guide](./VISUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md)

## Continuous Improvement

This workflow is reviewed and updated quarterly based on:
- Emerging responsive design patterns
- New device categories
- Team feedback
- Changes to browser rendering engines
