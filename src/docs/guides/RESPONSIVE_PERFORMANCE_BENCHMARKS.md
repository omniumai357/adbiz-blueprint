# Responsive Performance Benchmarks

This document outlines performance metrics, targets, and testing methodologies for ensuring optimal performance across all breakpoints and devices.

## Performance Metrics

### Core Web Vitals

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | Time until largest content element is visible | < 2.5s |
| FID (First Input Delay) | Time from first user interaction to response | < 100ms |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Measure of visual stability | < 0.1 |

These targets should be met across all device categories and breakpoints.

### Component-Specific Metrics

| Component Type | Initial Render | Interaction Response | Animation FPS |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Cards | < 100ms | < 50ms | > 30fps |
| Lists/Grids | < 150ms | < 75ms | > 30fps |
| Data Visualizations | < 200ms | < 100ms | > 24fps |
| Forms | < 120ms | < 60ms | > 30fps |
| Modals/Dialogs | < 100ms | < 50ms | > 30fps |
| Images | < 150ms | N/A | N/A |

## Device Performance Categories

Different device categories have different performance capabilities. Adjust expectations accordingly:

### Low-End Devices
- Entry-level smartphones (< 4GB RAM)
- Older browsers/OS versions
- 3G or unstable connections
- **Adjustment Factor**: Double the target times

### Mid-Range Devices
- Standard smartphones (4-6GB RAM)
- Tablets
- 4G connections
- **Adjustment Factor**: Standard targets apply

### High-End Devices
- Flagship smartphones (>6GB RAM)
- Laptops and desktops
- Wifi/high-speed connections
- **Adjustment Factor**: Targets should be exceeded by 50%

## Breakpoint-Specific Considerations

### Mobile Breakpoints (xs, sm)
- Prioritize critical content loading
- Reduce image dimensions and quality
- Simplify animations and transitions
- Limit DOM nodes to < 1500 elements
- Target total page size < 1MB

### Tablet Breakpoints (md)
- Allow more rich content and animations
- Optimize for touch interactions
- Limit DOM nodes to < 2500 elements
- Target total page size < 1.5MB

### Desktop Breakpoints (lg, xl, xxl)
- Can support richer interactions
- Higher quality images and animations
- More concurrent elements on screen
- Limit DOM nodes to < 3500 elements
- Target total page size < 2.5MB

## Measurement Methodology

### Manual Testing
1. Use browser DevTools Performance panel
2. Record separate traces for each breakpoint
3. Test both initial load and interaction scenarios
4. Document results in performance test reports

### Automated Testing
1. Lighthouse CI integration for production builds
2. Custom performance testing scripts for component-level metrics
3. WebPageTest for synthetic testing across devices
4. User-centric field metrics via Analytics

## Performance Budgets

### Javascript Budget
- Mobile: 300KB (gzipped)
- Tablet: 400KB (gzipped)
- Desktop: 500KB (gzipped)

### CSS Budget
- Mobile: 50KB (gzipped)
- Tablet: 75KB (gzipped) 
- Desktop: 100KB (gzipped)

### Image Budget
- Mobile: 500KB
- Tablet: 800KB
- Desktop: 1.2MB

## Optimization Techniques

### Code Optimization
- Tree-shaking and code splitting
- Lazy loading components off-screen
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Virtualization for long lists

### Responsive Asset Loading
- Use `srcset` and `sizes` for responsive images
- Consider screen density for high-DPI screens
- Lazy load non-critical images
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP, AVIF)

### Responsive Rendering
- Simpler components on mobile
- Higher detail on larger screens
- Conditional rendering based on breakpoint
- Server-side or edge rendering where appropriate

## Testing Schedule

- **Daily**: Automated performance tests in CI
- **Weekly**: Manual performance audits on critical flows
- **Bi-weekly**: Cross-device testing on physical devices
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive performance review of all pages
- **Quarterly**: Performance trend analysis and optimization planning

## Diagnostics and Remediation

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Potential Causes | Solutions |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Layout shifts on mobile | Images without dimensions | Add width/height attributes |
| | Dynamically injected content | Reserve space with min-height |
| Slow interactions | Heavy event handlers | Throttle/debounce handlers |
| | Unoptimized rerenders | Memoize components and values |
| Janky animations | CSS properties causing repaints | Use transform/opacity instead |
| | JavaScript-driven animations | Use CSS or Web Animations API |
| High memory usage | DOM size too large | Virtualize long lists |
| | Memory leaks in components | Fix useEffect cleanup functions |

### Documentation Requirements

For each performance issue identified:

1. Device/browser/OS combination
2. Reproducible test case
3. Performance traces or recordings
4. Root cause analysis
5. Implemented solution
6. Before/after metrics

## Continuous Monitoring

- Real User Monitoring (RUM) for production
- Synthetic monitoring for pre-production
- Performance regression alerts
- Device-specific performance dashboards

By following these guidelines, we can ensure our application delivers consistent performance across all breakpoints and devices, enhancing user experience regardless of how users access our application.
