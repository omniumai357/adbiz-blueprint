# Screen Reader Testing Plan for Tour Component

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan for ensuring the Tour component is fully accessible to users who rely on screen readers. The goal is to identify and resolve any accessibility issues before releasing the feature.

## Testing Tools

1. **Screen Readers to Test With:**
   - NVDA (Windows)
   - JAWS (Windows)
   - VoiceOver (Mac/iOS)
   - TalkBack (Android)

2. **Browsers to Test With:**
   - Chrome
   - Firefox
   - Safari
   - Edge

## Test Cases

### 1. Tour Initialization

- **Test Case 1.1:** Verify that when a tour starts, the screen reader announces the start of the tour.
- **Test Case 1.2:** Verify that the first step's title and content are properly announced.
- **Test Case 1.3:** Verify that navigation instructions are announced (keyboard shortcuts, etc.).

### 2. Navigation Between Steps

- **Test Case 2.1:** Verify that moving to the next step announces the new step's content.
- **Test Case 2.2:** Verify that moving to the previous step announces the new step's content.
- **Test Case 2.3:** Verify that the current step number and total steps are announced (e.g., "Step 2 of 5").
- **Test Case 2.4:** Verify that keyboard navigation works correctly with screen readers.

### 3. Step Content

- **Test Case 3.1:** Verify that all text content is properly read by screen readers.
- **Test Case 3.2:** Verify that images have proper alt text that is read by screen readers.
- **Test Case 3.3:** Verify that buttons and interactive elements have proper accessible names.

### 4. Focus Management

- **Test Case 4.1:** Verify that focus is properly managed when a tour starts (focus should move to the first interactive element in the tour).
- **Test Case 4.2:** Verify that focus is trapped within the tour dialog while it's active.
- **Test Case 4.3:** Verify that focus is properly restored when the tour ends.
- **Test Case 4.4:** Verify that focus indicators are visible for keyboard users.

### 5. Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Test Case 5.1:** Verify that all keyboard shortcuts are announced by screen readers.
- **Test Case 5.2:** Verify that the keyboard shortcuts help dialog is accessible.
- **Test Case 5.3:** Verify that keyboard shortcuts work correctly with screen readers active.

### 6. Tour Completion

- **Test Case 6.1:** Verify that the tour completion is properly announced.
- **Test Case 6.2:** Verify that focus is properly restored after tour completion.

### 7. ARIA Attributes

- **Test Case 7.1:** Verify that proper ARIA roles are used (dialog, region, etc.).
- **Test Case 7.2:** Verify that ARIA live regions are properly implemented.
- **Test Case 7.3:** Verify that ARIA attributes like aria-labelledby and aria-describedby are correctly implemented.

## Testing Procedure

1. Enable the screen reader.
2. Navigate to a page with the tour component.
3. Start the tour.
4. Follow each test case, documenting the results.
5. Pay special attention to:
   - What the screen reader announces
   - Focus management
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Ability to understand the tour's content and purpose

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. Inadequate or missing alternative text for visual elements.
2. Focus management issues (focus getting lost, not being trapped, or not being properly restored).
3. Insufficient context in screen reader announcements.
4. Interactive elements without accessible names.
5. Keyboard traps or inability to navigate with keyboard.
6. Content that is not read in a logical order.
7. Timing issues (content changing too quickly for screen reader users to process).

## Reporting Issues

For each issue found:
1. Document the screen reader and browser combination.
2. Describe the expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
3. Note the specific component and step where the issue occurred.
4. If possible, capture the exact announcement from the screen reader.
5. Suggest a potential fix.
