# Responsive Invoice System

This document outlines the implementation of our responsive invoice system, which ensures consistent display and functionality across all device sizes.

## Core Components

### 1. ResponsiveInvoiceViewer

The `ResponsiveInvoiceViewer` component provides a standardized way to display invoices with the following responsive features:

- Adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Provides zoom controls on larger screens
- Adjusts button layouts for touch interfaces on mobile
- Includes loading states for better user experience

### 2. Checkout Success Flow

The checkout success experience has been enhanced to:

- Show order confirmation in a clear, accessible format
- Display the generated invoice with print/download options
- Adapt the layout for different screen sizes
- Provide immediate feedback on invoice delivery status

### 3. Invoice Delivery Options

Users can choose how they receive their invoice:

- Email only (default)
- SMS only (requires phone number)
- Both email and SMS
- These options are presented in a responsive form during checkout

## Responsive Design Principles

### Mobile-First Approach

All invoice components are designed with a mobile-first mindset:

- Stacked layouts on small screens
- Simplified controls for touch interfaces
- Adjustable font sizes for readability
- Optimized data presentation for small viewports

### Breakpoints

Invoice components follow these breakpoints:

- `xs`: < 640px (Mobile portrait)
- `sm`: 640px-767px (Mobile landscape)
- `md`: 768px-1023px (Tablets)
- `lg`: 1024px-1279px (Small laptops/desktops)
- `xl`: â‰¥ 1280px (Desktops and large screens)

### Content Adaptation

The invoice content adapts to screen size:

- On mobile: Simplifies tables, focuses on key information
- On tablet: Maintains readability with adjusted layouts
- On desktop: Shows complete information with optimal spacing

## Technical Implementation

### Invoice HTML Template

The invoice HTML template includes:

- Responsive CSS using media queries
- Flexible layouts that adapt to different screens
- Print-optimized styling
- Mobile-friendly typography

### Edge Functions

Invoice generation and delivery utilize Supabase Edge Functions:

- `get-invoice`: Retrieves invoice data with HTML content
- `generate-invoice-pdf`: Creates downloadable PDF versions
- `send-invoice`: Handles delivery via email and/or SMS
- `resend-invoice`: Allows re-delivery of invoices as needed

### React Hooks

Custom hooks manage invoice interactions:

- `useOrderProcessing`: Coordinates order completion and invoice generation

## Testing Guide

### Device Testing

Test invoice views and interactions on:

- Mobile phones (iOS and Android)
- Tablets (portrait and landscape)
- Desktops (varying window sizes)

### Responsiveness Checks

For each device:

- Verify invoice content is fully readable
