# Comprehensive Site-Wide Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic plan for refactoring key areas of our codebase to enhance maintainability, readability, and performance while preserving all existing functionality. The plan prioritizes high-impact, low-risk changes that can be implemented incrementally.

## Prioritized Refactoring Targets

### 1. High Priority: Core UI Components (Impact: High, Risk: Medium)

| Component | Issues | Proposed Changes | Expected Benefits |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Form Fields | Inconsistent APIs, duplicate validation logic | Consolidate into a feature module with consistent API | Improved developer experience, reduced duplication |
| Navigation Components | Mixed responsibilities, prop drilling | Extract to feature module with context-based state | Better separation of concerns, easier navigation updates |
| Layout Components | Scattered across codebase | Create unified layout system | Consistent UI, easier responsive design |

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Create prototypes of refactored components in isolation
- Add comprehensive tests before refactoring
- Implement one component group at a time
- Use feature toggles to gradually roll out changes

### 2. Medium Priority: State Management (Impact: High, Risk: Medium)

| Area | Issues | Proposed Changes | Expected Benefits |
|------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Context Structure | Too many small contexts, prop drilling | Consolidate related contexts, use composition | Reduced complexity, better performance |
| Data Fetching | Mixed patterns (direct fetch, React Query) | Standardize on React Query patterns | Consistent caching, loading states |
| Form State | Duplicate logic across forms | Extract common patterns to reusable hooks | DRY code, consistent UX |

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Document current state flows before changes
- Implement new patterns alongside existing ones
- Create migration guides for each pattern
- Apply changes gradually across the application

### 3. Medium Priority: Hooks Organization (Impact: Medium, Risk: Low)

| Hook Category | Issues | Proposed Changes | Expected Benefits |
|---------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Feature Hooks | Scattered across `/hooks` | Move to feature folders | Better organization, clear ownership |
| Utility Hooks | Duplicate functionality | Consolidate and standardize | Less code, consistent patterns |
| Data Hooks | Missing caching, error handling | Enhance with consistent patterns | Better UX, fewer bugs |

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Apply the pattern used in file upload refactoring
- Create feature folders for related hooks
- Provide backward compatibility through re-exports
- Update imports gradually

### 4. Low Priority: Utility Functions (Impact: Medium, Risk: Low)

| Utility Area | Issues | Proposed Changes | Expected Benefits |
|--------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Formatting Utilities | Scattered, inconsistent | Consolidate into domain-specific modules | Easier to find and use |
| Validation Functions | Duplication, inconsistent error formats | Standardize on zod patterns | Consistent validation, better DX |
| Helper Functions | Mixed concerns, poor naming | Reorganize by domain, improve naming | Self-documenting code |

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Start with documenting existing utilities
- Create new organization structure
- Provide backward compatibility
- Update imports in small PRs

## Technical Debt Hotspots

Based on codebase analysis, these areas have accumulated significant technical debt:

1. **Checkout Flow Components**
   - Long, complex components with mixed concerns
   - Tightly coupled business logic and UI
   - Recommendation: Apply container/presenter pattern

2. **Auth System**
   - Scattered auth logic across components and hooks
   - Inconsistent error handling
   - Recommendation: Consolidate into feature module with clear API

3. **Questionnaire Forms**
   - Duplicated validation and state management
   - Large components with multiple responsibilities
   - Recommendation: Break into smaller components with focused hooks

## Implementation Approach

### Guiding Principles

1. **Maintain Stability**: All refactoring must preserve existing functionality.
2. **Test Before Change**: Add tests before refactoring to catch regressions.
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Apply changes in small, manageable steps.
4. **Documentation**: Document the before and after of each refactoring.
5. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for larger changes to enable rollbacks.

### Timeline and Phasing

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Add test coverage to target areas
- Document current patterns and APIs
- Create feature module templates

**Phase 2: Low-Hanging Fruit (Weeks 3-4)**
- Refactor utility functions
- Apply hook organization patterns
- Address simple component refactoring

**Phase 3: Core Components (Weeks 5-8)**
- Refactor form components
- Implement layout system improvements
- Address navigation components

**Phase 4: State Management (Weeks 9-12)**
- Improve context organization
- Standardize data fetching patterns
- Enhance form state management

### Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes | Medium | High | Thorough testing, feature flags, gradual rollout |
| Performance regressions | Medium | Medium | Performance testing before/after, monitoring |
| Developer resistance | Low | Medium | Clear documentation, training, highlighting benefits |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | Buffer time in schedule, prioritize by impact |

## Measurement and Success Criteria

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Reduced bundle size
- Decreased component complexity (lines of code, cyclomatic complexity)
- Improved test coverage
- Reduced number of bugs in refactored areas

**Qualitative Metrics:**
- Developer satisfaction with codebase
- Ease of onboarding new developers
- Time to implement new features in refactored areas

## Conclusion

This refactoring plan provides a structured approach to improving our codebase while maintaining stability and functionality. By prioritizing high-impact, low-risk changes and implementing them incrementally, we can significantly improve code quality, maintainability, and developer experience without disrupting ongoing development work.

The plan should be revisited and adjusted based on feedback and changing priorities. Regular updates on progress and lessons learned should be shared with the development team.

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan with the development team
2. Collect feedback and adjust priorities if needed
3. Begin test coverage improvements for high-priority areas
4. Create detailed implementation plans for Phase 1

## Appendix: Additional Refactoring Opportunities

- **Styling System**: Move toward more consistent use of Tailwind utility classes
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error boundaries and error handling patterns
- **Accessibility**: Systematic improvement of component accessibility
- **Internationalization**: Better organization of translation files and utilities
