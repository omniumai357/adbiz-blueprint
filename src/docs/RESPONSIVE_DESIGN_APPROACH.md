# Responsive Design Approach

This document outlines our comprehensive approach to implementing responsive design across the application, with a focus on the invoice and checkout systems.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Mobile-First Development

We start by designing and implementing for the smallest screens first, then progressively enhance for larger screens. This ensures our application is fundamentally usable on mobile devices rather than treating mobile as an afterthought.

### 2. Component-Based Adaptivity

Each component is responsible for its own responsiveness. Components use a combination of:

- Flexible layouts (Flexbox/Grid)
- Responsive typography
- Conditional rendering based on screen size
- Touch-optimized interactions on mobile

### 3. Consistent Breakpoints

We use standardized breakpoints across the entire application:

```
xs: < 640px     (Mobile portrait)
sm: 640-767px   (Mobile landscape)
md: 768-1023px  (Tablets)
lg: 1024-1279px (Laptops/small desktops)
xl: 1280-1535px (Desktops)
xxl: ≥ 1536px   (Large displays)
```

### 4. Minimal Media Query Usage

We leverage Tailwind's responsive utilities (e.g., `md:flex-row`, `lg:gap-8`) to reduce custom media queries. This creates a more consistent approach to responsive design across the application.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Responsive Components

We've created reusable components that abstract responsive behavior:

- `ResponsiveCheckoutLayout`: Adapts the checkout flow for different screens
- `ResponsiveFormSection`: Provides consistent form layouts across devices
- `ResponsiveInvoiceViewer`: Displays invoices optimized for any screen

### 2. Hook-Based Responsive Logic

Our custom hooks handle responsive logic centrally:

- `useResponsive`: Provides viewport information and device detection
- `useResponsiveLayout`: Determines optimal layouts based on screen size

### 3. Responsive Context

Content adapts appropriately to available space:

- Tables transform to card layouts on small screens
- Long content truncates intelligently on mobile
- Interactive elements have appropriate touch targets

### 4. Performance Considerations

Our responsive implementation considers performance:

- Avoids unnecessary re-renders when screen size changes
- Optimizes image loading for different viewports
- Minimizes layout shifts during responsive transitions

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Device Testing Matrix

We test across a range of devices to ensure comprehensive coverage:

| Category | Primary Devices | Secondary Devices |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Mobile   | iPhone SE, Samsung Galaxy S21 | iPhone 13 Pro, Google Pixel 6 |
| Tablet   | iPad (9th gen), Samsung Tab S7 | iPad Pro 12.9", Surface Pro |
| Desktop  | 1080p monitor, 1366x768 laptop | 4K display, ultrawide monitor |

### 2. Testing Protocol

For each significant component or page:

1. Test at each breakpoint (focus on transition points)
2. Verify touch interactions on mobile/tablet
3. Test keyboard navigation on desktop
4. Check for content overflow or layout issues
5. Validate print layouts (for invoices and receipts)

## Best Practices & Guidelines

### Layout Patterns

- Use `flex-col md:flex-row` for stacking on mobile, side-by-side on larger screens
- Apply `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` for responsive grids
- Use containers with `max-w-[size]` and centered content

### Typography & Spacing

- Base font size: 16px (responsive)
- Heading scales: Reduce by 1 level on mobile (h1 → h2, etc.)
- Button sizes: Minimum 44px touch target on mobile
- Spacing: Use smaller gaps on mobile, larger on desktop

### User Experience Considerations

- Design mobile experiences for one-handed operation
- Ensure critical actions are always visible without scrolling
- Adapt content density to screen size (more concentrated on desktop)
- Provide feedback on all interactions, especially on mobile

## Specific Implementation Examples

### Responsive Checkout Flow

```tsx
{isMobile ? (
  // Mobile layout (stacked)
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <OrderSummary />
    <CheckoutForm />
  </div>
) : (
  // Desktop layout (side-by-side)
  <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-8">
    <div className="col-span-2">
      <CheckoutForm />
    </div>
    <div>
      <OrderSummary />
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### Responsive Form Elements

```tsx
<FormField className="col-span-1 md:col-span-2">
  <FormLabel className="text-sm md:text-base">
    Email Address
  </FormLabel>
  <FormControl>
    <Input 
      className="h-10 md:h-12 text-sm md:text-base px-3 md:px-4" 
      placeholder="Enter your email"
    />
  </FormControl>
</FormField>
```

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements to our responsive implementation:

1. Create a design system documentation with responsive examples
2. Implement automated testing for responsive behaviors
3. Create responsive variants for all common components
4. Enhance responsive image handling with art direction
5. Optimize animations for different device capabilities
