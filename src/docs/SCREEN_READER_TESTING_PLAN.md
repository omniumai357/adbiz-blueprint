## Testing Procedure

1. **Preparation:**
   - Enable the screen reader
   - Navigate to a page with the tour component
   - Set up recording if possible to capture announcements
   - Have test cases ready for reference

2. **For each test case:**
   - Perform the specified action
   - Note what the screen reader announces
   - Compare with expected behavior
   - Document any discrepancies

3. **Focus specifically on:**
   - Completeness of announcements
   - Clarity of instructions
   - Logical flow of information
   - Ability to navigate using keyboard only

## Reporting and Tracking Issues

All issues identified during testing should be:
1. Documented with clear reproduction steps
2. Categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Assigned to the appropriate developer
4. Re-tested after fixes are implemented

## Continuous Improvement

Schedule periodic re-testing of the tour component with screen readers to ensure:
1. No regression in accessibility
2. Compatibility with new screen reader versions
3. Identification of new optimization opportunities
